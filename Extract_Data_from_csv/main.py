Read multiple CSV files to extract desired data / Filter or categorize data basen on the following.

    1. Create a CSV file that contains all employees with all their information extracted from all
        given files.
        Sort by = customer ID, ascending
        ORDER = ID, FIRST NAME, LAST NAME, SALARY, EMPLOYER, CITY

    2. Create csv file per employer, e.g. google.csv will contain list of customers that work for Google.
        Sorted by = employer name, alphabetically
        ORDER= FIRST NAME, LAST NAME, EMPLOYER. SORT

    3. Create CSV files for employees in each city, e.g. Houston.csv will contain employees from
        houston only.
        Sort by = City, alphabetically
        ORDER = ID, FIRST NAME, LAST NAME, CITY

    INPUT FILES:
        employee.csv
        employer.csv
        salaries.csv
